# RobloxDiogenes
Convert files to Roblox compatible diogenes files, or decrypt them

## Usage
Open up in Visual Studio and click Build, or download the latest release at the [Releases tab](https://github.com/lighterlightbulb/RobloxDiogenes/releases).

Input the file name, or file path to the diogenes file. It will write a `diogenes_output.fnt` to the current working directory of where you have stored the executable.
